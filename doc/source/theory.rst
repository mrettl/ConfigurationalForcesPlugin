Theory

This section explains how the configurational stresses and forces are derived.
For the computation of the configurational forces, the deformation gradient and the
first Piola-Kirchhoff stresses are needed.
For this reason, they are explained also.
Furthermore, the aspects of finite elements relevant for the evaluation
of configurational forces are described.
