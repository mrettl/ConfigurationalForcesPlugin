Welcome to CF3D documentation!
==========================================

The explanation on how to install the package, useful information on what it does and what the functionality is and
a theoretical introduction should be placed here.

All the documentation of the modules is done with just the few lines of directives as shown here. If the
code is documented inline, this is all it takes to add whole modules to the documentation.
